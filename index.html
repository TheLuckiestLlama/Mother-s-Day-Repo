            <p>I decided a card was a little too easy, so I made a digital one!</p>
            <p>The formatting might be a bit goofy, seeing as this is a card on a website.</p>
            <p>Dear Mom,</p>
            <p>I know it's been rough the past few weeks with everything going on. I know I probably don't say it enough, but I love you. I hope you have a wonderful Mother's Day.</p>
            <p>Love, Daniel </p>
